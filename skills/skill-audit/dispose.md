# Fix Pass

This pass re-verifies one audit report and fixes its findings. The session running it must not be the one that wrote the report.

1. **Find the report.** Use the newest `<skill>-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` in the report folder that has `## Findings` and no `## Disposition` heading. If there is none, say the audit is already closed and stop. If the project is a git repository, note the current commit (`git rev-parse HEAD`) so the user can review or revert the fixes as one diff.
2. **Re-verify each finding.** Line numbers move, so search the whole file for each quote. Then read the quote in context. Give each finding one outcome:
   - fixed as written;
   - fixed with a correction;
   - not a finding;
   - already fixed;
   - pending the user.
3. **Fix what is clear.** Fix it yourself if it is reversible and has one sensible answer: a dead pointer, an orphaned file's rule moved into the load path, or a stale step number.
   - **Contradictions:** resolve toward the newer side by default, using the report's dates. Resolve toward the older side only when you can state why.
   - **Preference calls:** when the right fix depends on something only the user knows, such as which of two rules they actually want, ask them. Give lettered options, the tradeoffs of each, and your recommendation.
   - **Keep edits minimal.** Prefer deleting or correcting the stale text over adding new text. A contradiction is usually fixed by removing one side, not by adding a third rule that explains the other two.
   - **Skills you don't own:** if the skill came from a plugin or another author's repository, record the findings and edit nothing. Plugin updates overwrite local edits, so a report to the upstream author is the durable fix.
4. **Close the report** once no finding is pending the user. Until then the report stays open, and `/skill-audit <skill> fix` resumes it after the user answers. To close it, append `## Disposition (<YYYY-MM-DD>)` to the report. Give each finding's number and outcome on one line, with the correction or reason where the outcome needs one. List every file you changed.
5. **Report to the user.** Summarize what changed, what was dismissed, and what waits on them.
